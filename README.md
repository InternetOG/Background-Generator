# Background-Generator
# This JavaScript code creates a dynamic web page that allows users to choose two colors and creates a linear gradient background between the two selected colors. The selected colors are displayed as CSS code which can be copied to the clipboard by clicking a "Copy me" button. Additionally, there is a "Random color" button that generates two random hexadecimal color values and updates the gradient background and CSS code accordingly. The code uses JavaScript DOM manipulation to select elements on the page, update their values and styles, and dynamically create new elements and events. The code adds interactivity and customization to the web page, making it a fun and engaging user experience.
